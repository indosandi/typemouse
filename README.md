Type Position of Mouse. Inspired by vim where movement of cursor is typed.

Program in java that can change mouse position by typing. Combination of letter will appear on screen then typing it will locate mouse position

-----------------
To try,

Compile: javac Main.java

Key combination
  1. Typing letter on screen will bring cursor to the location
  2. 'h' left 1 block, 'j' down 1 block, 'k' up 1 block, and 'l' right 1 block
  3. 'o' decrease block distance ( for finer movement)
  4.  'i' increase block distance ( for larger movement)
